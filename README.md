# ABS_API
Demonstrating use of the ABS API and automatically downloading latest releases into a pyplot

This a short program that demonstrates how to connect to the ABS API. 

The ABS provides access to datasets in ABS.Stat through a RESTful application programming interface (API) based on the SDMX-JSON standard. 
This allows anyone to easily call the API using a simple RESTful URL.

The program shows how to parse through the JSON files and prepare the data for visualisation and analysis. 

For example, economic indicators such as the unemployment rate, CPI, GDP and current account balance are collected and plotted on simple charts.
